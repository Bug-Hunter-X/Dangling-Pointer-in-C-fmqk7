This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: dangling pointers. A dangling pointer occurs when a pointer variable points to a memory location that has been freed or is no longer valid.  The example shows a simple function where a pointer points to a local variable that goes out of scope, causing the pointer to become dangling. The solution shows how to avoid this by dynamically allocating memory using malloc and freeing the allocated memory using free to prevent memory leaks and ensure safe pointer usage.
